Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words

The upstream remote is basically the continuation and tracking of the project branch in terms of a timeline and work input to the repository. Creating this upstream remote, keeps track of this original repository, since when you cloned the original repository, it's default remote 'origin' points to your fork on Gibhub of the original repository, and not the continuation of that time line.  In otherwards, the upstream remote tracks subsequent changes to the repository you have cloned in order to provide a more efficient working platform through ensuring you have taken into consideration subsequent changes to the project, since your original clone.
